For almost fifty years, the Inkatha Freedom Party, founded by Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi, 
has championed democracy, freedom and justice, serving the poor and the vulnerable, while 
creating a country in which we all can thrive. The IFP is the greatest legacy of Prince Buthelezi. 
In 2024, we are taking that legacy forward.
The IFP has had a powerful influence in South Africa. Starting with the freedom struggle, we 
protected the citizenship of millions of disenfranchised South Africans whom an illegitimate 
government sought to make foreigners in our own land.
At the negotiating table, it was the IFP that secured the creation of provinces and the inclusion 
of a Bill of Rights in our democratic Constitution. As part of the Government of National Unity, 
we were instrumental in transforming the full body of law in South Africa to reflect the values 
of a constitutional democracy.
In KwaZulu-Natal, we governed for ten years, growing the provincial economy and putting 
the power of governance into the hands of the people.
With such a strong start, it has been deeply painful to see South Africa led astray by a majority 
party that became drunk with power. Over the last thirty years, our country’s economy 
has declined, criminality – including crimes against women and children – has exploded, 
corruption has taken hold, and basic services have become another broken promise.
In 2024, the need for a change of government is critical.
For thirty years, the IFP has been a formidable opposition, holding Government to account. 
We have consistently led by example, showing what a government of integrity can achieve 
for South Africa.
In 2024, we invite you to bring integrity back into government by voting for the IFP.
Your vote for the IFP in 2024, on both the national and provincial ballots, will strengthen 
the voice of integrity in the incoming government. The IFP’s values are founded on the 
principles of ubuntu/botho and integrity, and it is that more than anything else that is lacking 
in governance.
I therefore invite you to vote for a new Govern
